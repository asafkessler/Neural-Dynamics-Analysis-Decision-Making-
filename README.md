### Dopamine Dynamics and Behavioral Neural Data Analysis

This project explores the neural and behavioral dynamics of reward-based decision-making in animal models. By analyzing photometry signals and spiking activity recorded during experiments, the project aims to uncover insights into dopamine responses, reward prediction errors, and behavioral strategies under varying conditions.

#### Key Objectives:
1. **Dopamine Responses to Rewards and Omissions**  
   - Analyze photometry signals to compare neural activity during rewarded and unrewarded trials.
   - Generate heatmaps, average response traces, and statistical analyses to identify significant differences in neural activity.

2. **Reward Prediction Error Analysis**  
   - Examine neural responses under varying reward probabilities (20% vs. 80%) to characterize reward prediction errors.
   - Explore the influence of trial history on dopamine responses using photometry data.

3. **Behavioral Analysis of Decision-Making**  
   - Investigate the proportion of trials in which the animal selects the higher-probability reward target, quantifying optimal behavior.
   - Create and analyze raster plots of spiking activity for different task conditions.

4. **Peristimulus Time Histogram (PSTH) Analysis**  
   - Generate PSTHs to visualize firing rates during trials with varying reward probabilities.
   - Smooth and compare PSTHs across conditions to reveal task-specific neuronal activity patterns.

5. **Quantitative Analysis of Neuronal Responses**  
   - Perform regression analyses to examine how average spiking activity correlates with task parameters such as reward probabilities.
   - Compare neuronal modulation across different neurons and task conditions.

6. **Comparative Analysis Across Neurons**  
   - Investigate inter-neuronal differences in response to task parameters.
   - Analyze how the non-selected target's reward probability modulates neural activity.

#### Tools and Techniques:
- **Data Visualization**: Heatmaps, line plots, raster plots, PSTHs, and regression visualizations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: T-tests, linear regression, and smoothed averages for quantitative comparisons.
- **Python Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy.

#### Key Insights:
This project highlights the neural mechanisms of decision-making under uncertainty and 
sheds light on the role of dopamine in encoding reward prediction errors. By leveraging computational and statistical tools, 
the project provides a comprehensive analysis of behavioral and neuronal responses in a controlled experimental setting.
